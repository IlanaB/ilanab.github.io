		Here's some more information about me:

		* JavaScript
		* CSS
		* HTML
		* Node

		Frameworks/Concepts/Libraries:
		* ReactJS (and Flux/Redux)
		* KnockoutJS
		* RequireJS
		* Socket.io
		* Angular (since this is a big one for a lot of people I want to clarify that I worked happily but for a short time on a project using Angular - that being said I consider myself no expert on it)

		I'm very comfortable with LESS/SASS

		Tools:
		* GIT/Stash
